once upon a time, in a forest there was a monkey who recited on a berry tree on the banks of the river. in the same forest there lived a croc and his wife.
The monkey wanted to make cloths from himself using croc skin he slowly stated trying to befriend the croc by feeding him berrys.The berrys were yummy and the croc loved them.
after awhile the monkey stated to poision the berrys.The croc died and the monkey got new cloths.
